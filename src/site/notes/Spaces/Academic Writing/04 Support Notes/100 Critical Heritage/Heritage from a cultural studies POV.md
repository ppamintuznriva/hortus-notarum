Stuart Hall asked "Whose heritage?" we are seeking to preserve in heritage projects, and what power these ascriptions have over what we deem as important and unimportant.

Context about 'Whose Heritage' (from [[Sources/200 Zotero Annotations/@ashleyWhoseHeritageChallenging2023\|@ashleyWhoseHeritageChallenging2023]])

Hallâ€™s â€˜[[Spaces/Academic Writing/04 Support Notes/100 Critical Heritage/ðŸŒ³ Whose Heritage?\|ðŸŒ³ Whose Heritage?]]â€™ speech in 1999 was a product of these long years as a vocal public intellectual in the United Kingdom. He was then an emeritus scholar from the Open University and delivered the address at the Whose Heritage? conference organised in Manchester by the Arts Council of England (ACE). This event brought together culture, heritage and arts practitioners and policymakers for the first time in order to debate and challenge ==the concept of heritage in response to an increasingly multicultural Britain== (ACE, 1999). Hallâ€™s speech called on a re-examination of ==British [[Spaces/Academic Writing/04 Support Notes/100 Critical Heritage/heritage as a living activity â€“ not only the conservation of the past\|heritage as a living activity â€“ not only the conservation of the past]] â€“ that included diasporic traditions as well as their arts and creativity==.
