Not only is there a [[Spaces/Academic Writing/04 Support Notes/100 Critical Heritage/"plurality of use and consumption of heritage"\|"plurality of use and consumption of heritage"]] [@grahamGeographyHeritagePower2000, 5], there is a plurarity of heritage itself especially in heterogenous urban spaces like Baguio City. This plurality and heterogeneity will seem counterintutitive in from the perspective of traditional, nationalist discourses on heritage that favor a cohesive narrative for heritage preservation.
