We need four tools:
- Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do) 
- A reference management system (the best programs are free) 
- The slip-box (the best program is free) 
- An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free) More is unnecessary, less is impossible. â€” location: [564]()
