**Hi there! You've found my digital garden! ðŸŒ»**

My name is Paula/Z (she/her, they/them), and I am a researcher and editor based in Baguio City, Philippines. 

This space serves as a repository of my living thoughts, things I'm learning, rabbit holes I fall into, etc. Not quite a blog in the usual sense, here you will find initial thoughts, growing ideas, notes on stuff I am reading, maybe some essays here and there, all in the spirit of learning in public. 

Like most digital gardens, I write here mostly for myself, from my personal Obsidian vault (my greenhouse). While it *is* curated, it's not always organized (and that's the beauty of it!). 

**As you explore:**
1. *Embrace the unrefined*: Some/most ideas here are works in progress. I could be wrong and/or I could be right, and that's ok!
3. *Follow your gut*: These thoughts are not strictly organized, feel free to jump between links and see where they take you.
4. *Check timestamps*: Note when a piece was last tended to.
5. *Engage thoughtfully*: Comments and discussions are welcome, you can find me on X/Twitter at [@ppamintuznriva](https://x.com/ppamintuznriva).
6. *Be a responsible visitor:* Not sure where you stand in the digital garden? Check the [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) by Shawn Wang.
