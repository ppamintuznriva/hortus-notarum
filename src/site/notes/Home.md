**Hi there! You've found my digital garden! ðŸŒ»**

My name is Paula/Z, and I am a researcher and editor based in Baguio City, Philippines. 

This space serves as a repository of my living thoughts, things I learn, rabbit holes I fall into, etc. Not quite a blog in the classical sense, here you will find initial thoughts, growing ideas, notes on stuff I am reading,  maybe some essays here and there, all in the spirit of learning in public. While it *is* curated, it's not always organized (and that's the beauty of it).

As you explore:
1. Embrace the unpolished: Some/most ideas here are works in progress, and that's OK.
2. Follow your gut: These thoughts are not strictly organized, feel free to jump between links and see where they take you.
3. Check timestamps: Note when a piece was last tended to.
6. Engage thoughtfully: Comments and discussions are welcome, you can find me on X/Twitter at [@ppamintuznriva](https://x.com/ppamintuznriva).
7. Be a responsible visitor: Not sure where you stand in the digital garden? Check the [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) by Shawn Wang.

Feel free to wander, ponder, and watch how these ideas grow over time. 
Happy visiting!
