#### Hi there! You've found my digital garden! 🌻

My name is Paula/Z (she/her, they/them), and I am a researcher and editor based in Baguio City, Philippines. If you're looking for my CV, it's [[About Me\|here]].

This space serves as a repository of my living thoughts, things I'm learning, rabbit holes I fall into, etc. Not quite a blog in the usual sense, here you will find initial thoughts, growing ideas, notes on stuff I am reading, maybe some essays here and there, all in the spirit of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). 

Like most digital gardeners, I write here mostly for myself—rather, my future self—from my personal Obsidian vault (my greenhouse). While it *is* curated, it's not always organized (and that's the beauty of it!). 

#### As you explore:
1. *Embrace the unrefined*: Some/most ideas here are works in progress. I could be wrong and/or I could be right, and that's ok!
3. *Feel free to wander*: These thoughts are not strictly organized, feel free to jump between links and see where they take you. (You'll notice that some links are still beiged [?] out, that's because I haven't finished deploying everything from my greenhouse as I am actually currently busy writing)
4. *Check timestamps*: Note when a piece was last tended to.
5. *Engage thoughtfully*: Comments and discussions are welcome, you can find me on X/Twitter at [@mapalupari](https://x.com/mapalupari). The anonymous [[Digital Gardening/Feedback Form\|Feedback Form]] is up now!
6. *Be a responsible visitor:* Not sure where you stand in the digital garden? Check the [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) by Shawn Wang.
