The anonymous feedback form is now up! Fill it out below or find it [here](https://forms.gle/81xu1z8ittS7nY7z6).

I couldn't recall the original source of this idea, but thanks to my second brain, I was able to trace back to where THAT idea came from. Anyway, the link to Luke Muehlhauser's own feedback form is [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZNX79yiIIsB9DlmhJBX_3_F1Yz-Lf_QhPWBMdc48PQ6IBLQ/viewform?formkey=dG1tUklRelVZdkJscThTV3dKZ1NJb0E6MQ) if you'd like to check that out.

He says: 
"Luke is a primate, so if you tell him one or two specific things you like about his work, he is more likely to actually consider any criticisms you might have for him." 

And, honestly? Same. I appreciate any feedback you may have for me.
