Basically, a declaration of how I know what I know, the level of confidence/belief I have that what I know is true, and how much effort I've put into knowing what I know.

Right now, I have disclosures on [[Digital Gardening/epistemic status\|epistemic status]] and [[Digital Gardening/epistemic effort\|epistemic effort]], but I want to [[Digital Gardening/Digital Garden To Do List#Housekeeping\|fix how the callouts look]] a little bit .

Right now, looks like this

>[!info] [[Digital Gardening/epistemic status\|epistemic status]]:
>semi-believed. i think this is right, but this needs more engagement to understand and utilize

What if:

[ *[[Digital Gardening/epistemic status\|epistemic status]]: semi-believed. i think this is right, but this needs more engagement to understand and utilize* ]
