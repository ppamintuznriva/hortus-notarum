Still not decided on how exactly I want to do this, but the following seem like good places to start.

From [Muflax](https://webcitation.org/6DuYcqyQ3):
- **believed** - As far as I know, everything on that page is correct. I endorse it as-written and don’t expect there to be more than minor errors.
- **semi-believed** - The general point is fine, but there are important gaps or parts that are significantly less certain than I originally thought. A rewrite can probably save the conclusion, but be careful.
- **not believed** - It’s just wrong and I changed my mind since I wrote it. Sometimes I note why, and sometimes I disown those topics entirely.
- **speculation** - Just some random idea that I wanted to write more about so I could understand it better. I don’t take it seriously, but it was interesting enough to spend some time with it. That’s the default state.
- **fiction** - It’s complicated. Generally speaking, _some_ aspects of it I do believe. Sometimes it represents a marginalized aspect of me. Some days I just don’t want to care about making my reasoning clear; I just want to _write_ something. Or maybe I felt like trolling. Regardless, don’t base your world-view on fiction, please. Fiction is treason.
- **emotional** - Some cluster of ideas that got itself entangled with a complex emotional state, and I needed to externalize it to even look at it. The ideas are in no way endorsed, but writing about them is occasionally necessary (similar to fiction).
- **log** - Log entries that simply describe what happened without any judgment or reflection. I haven’t thought about it much, I just wrote it down.

From [Gwern](https://gwern.net/about#confidence-tags): "used to express my feeling about how well-supported the essay is, or how likely it is the overall ideas are right."

log
emotional
fiction
“certain”
“highly likely”
“likely”
“possible” (my preference over Kesselman’s “Chances a Little Better [or Less]”)
“unlikely”
“highly unlikely”
“impossible”
