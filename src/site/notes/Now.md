**Right now:**

Still cannot wrap my head around being actually published now, and what that means in terms of contributing to knowledge. I am excited about the possibilities and challenged by the responsibilities!

Picked up on digital gardening again now that I'm (for the moment) done with writing.

Why a *Now* Page?Â While building this garden, I saw the idea of a *Now* page on [Teresa Watts'](https://teresawatts.com/) website, as well as some others and thought that it would be cool to have one, too. I will update when I remember to, hehe. Inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about)
