**Right now:**

Both the papers I submitted received positive reviews, with very helpful comments from reviewers that I'm (genuinely) looking forward to revising after I finish drafting a third paper (!!!). The CSC has also been engaging in conversations with students and faculty about research, Cordillera Studies, and digital tools and it's been very exciting and gratifying to share about personal knowledge management and Zettelkasten. I'm also applying for funding to present at a Conference in Melbourne later this year! Whewww

Still tending to my digital garden when I can. I recently updated my [[Gardening/WTWF? (What's the workflow?)\|workflow as of September 2024]] and posted my [[Efforts/PKM + Hobbies/04 Support Notes/Zotero Tag Taxonomy\|Zotero Tag Taxonomy]] and [[How to add visual tags to Zotero (Quick and Dirty)\|How to add visual tags to Zotero (Quick and Dirty)]].

Why a *Now* Page?Â While building this garden, I saw the idea of a *Now* page on [Teresa Watts'](https://teresawatts.com/)website, as well as some others and thought that it would be cool to have one, too. I will update when I remember to, hehe. Inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about)
