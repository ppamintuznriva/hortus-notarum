**Right now:**

I currently have two papers submitted to journals. Yay! Still, I am waiting for responses and in the meantime, I'm on the lookout for higher degree by research supervisors so I can work on childhood studies or critical heritage studies more (there is so much to read! but here's what I'm [[Atlas/ðŸ“‹ Currently Reading\|ðŸ“‹ Currently Reading]]). I've decided to start work on another heritage paper, this time more theoretical/methodological in relation to Barthes' *Mythologies*, and I am excited! Hoping to receive more good news soon, but bracing myself for otherwise.

I'm setting up and tending to my digital garden (still). Work-wise, we are deep in production for the next TCR volume so that occupies most of my 8 to 5 these days.

Why a *Now* Page?Â While building this garden, I saw the idea of a *Now* page on [Teresa Watts'](https://teresawatts.com/)website, as well as some others and thought that it would be cool to have one, too. I will update when I remember to, hehe. Inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about)
