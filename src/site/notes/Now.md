**Right now:**

I currently have two papers submitted to journals. Yay! Still, I am waiting for responses and in the meantime, I'm very keen on looking for higher degree supervisors so I can work on critical heritage studies more (there is so much to read! What I'm [[Atlas/ðŸ“‹ Currently Reading\|ðŸ“‹ Currently Reading]]). I'm setting up and tending to my digital garden. Work-wise, we are deep in production for the next TCR volume so that occupies most of my 8 to 5 these dat.

Why a Now Page?Â While building this garden, I saw it on [Teresa Watts'](https://teresawatts.com/)website, as well as some others and thought that it would be cool to have one, too. I will update when I remember to, hehe. Inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about)
