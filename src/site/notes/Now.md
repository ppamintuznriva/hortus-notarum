**Right now:**
I currently have two papers submitted to journals. Yay! Still, I am waiting for responses and in the meantime, I am reading up on methodologies (what I'm [[Atlas/ðŸ“‹ Currently Reading\|ðŸ“‹ Currently Reading]]), drafting personal statements, and tending to my digital garden. We are deep into work for the next TCR volume so that occupies most of my time.

Why a Now Page?Â While building this garden, I saw it on [Teresa Watts'](https://teresawatts.com/)website, as well as some others and thought that it would be cool to have one, too. I will update when I remember to, hehe. Inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about)
