>[!TLDR] TL;DR
>obtaining deconstructive validity means evaluating research according to its ability to tease out, unravel and expose ingrained structures of power through an analysis of language

- from a poststructuralist methodological approach
- corresponds to the structuralist bent of early [[cultural studies\|cultural studies]]
- evaluates research in terms of how well it unravels problematic social discourses that mediate the way in which we perceive reality and other people
- In Mead's Samoa research, this could mean assessing "how thoroughly it unmasks the colonialist tropes that describe Samoa in terms of 'primitive' sexuality"

>[!quote] "argues that there is no 'unbiased' way of comprehending the world" (21)
>Good research:
>- exposes historicity, political investments, omissions and blind spots of social 'truths'
>- is aware of its own historical, political and social investments, continuously reflecting back on its own commitments

### Three specific criteria for 'good' or valid research

1. *Postmodern excess* - there is a potentially infinite number of truths or ways of approaching reality; assesses how research highlights the multiple ways that a particular phenomenon can be understood
2. *Genealogical historicity* - associated with Foucault (1984), challenges truths by exposing their historicity
3. *Deconstructive critique* - associated with the work of Derrida (1976), questions binaries that organize thought, research evaluated by how it unearths those binaries
