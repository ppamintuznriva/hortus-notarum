>In describing the attributes or actions of the native, issues such as intention, causality, extenuating circumstances, and so forth, are completely ignored; in the ‘imaginary’ colonialist realm, ==to say ‘native’ is automatically to say ‘evil’ and to evoke immediately the economy of the manichean allegory.== The writer of such texts tends to fetishize a nondialectical, fixed opposition between the self and the native.([19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AP4X9TIW?page=2&annotation=PQYWKWTWq))
