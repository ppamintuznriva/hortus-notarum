[Performing Care and Carelessness Conference](https://www.otago.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/502777/CFP-Performing-Care-and-Carelessness-Conference.pdf)

Care is both an affective orientation (I.e. ‘caring about’) and a practice (I.e. ‘caring for’, or ‘taking care of’). As such, it is something that is both performed, and performative; attached to embodied subjectivities, in which it takes on polysemic potential as a communicative and symbolic as well as relational act. 


> [!summary] my note
> care is something that we do and something that we feel. or, is something we feel and we do. thus, it is something that emanates from an internal place, manifested through actions, engendering a wealth of meaning and interpretation.
