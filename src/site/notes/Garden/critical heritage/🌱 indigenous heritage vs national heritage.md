Tension inherent in the determination of "heritage" following guidelines set by international, national or even academic bodies. (integrated in [[BH TCR Revision Action Points\|BH TCR Revision Action Points]])

In instances where indigenous heritage is recognized, where does it figure in the overall scheme of heritage discourse? What is its role and what does this role mean in the grand scheme of things? 

Related: the idea that [[distinct does not mean separate\|distinct does not mean separate]] in heterogenous societies; there is hybridity and mixing and that is ok.

Is it even enough to include elements of indigenous culture or does it remain that [[ü´ö Recognition must lead to redistribution to be effective\|ü´ö Recognition must lead to redistribution to be effective]]? 

[[token inclusion vs tangible benefits\|token inclusion vs tangible benefits]] -> this is KEY in the current political discourse. is it enough to recognize Ibaloy heritage/the Ibaloy as actors in the city's heritage while wholly blocking them from making land claims.
