Tension inherent in the determination of "heritage" following guidelines set by international, national or even academic bodies.

In instances where indigenous heritage is recognized, where does it figure in the overall scheme of heritage discourse? What is its role and what does this role mean in the grand scheme of things? 

Related: the idea that [[distinct does not mean separate\|distinct does not mean separate]] in heterogenous societies; there is hybridity and mixing and that is ok.

Is it even enough to include elements of indigenous culture or does it remain that [[Garden/critical heritage/🫚 Recognition must lead to redistribution to be effective\|🫚 Recognition must lead to redistribution to be effective]]? 

token inclusion vs tangible benefits (land, etc.)
