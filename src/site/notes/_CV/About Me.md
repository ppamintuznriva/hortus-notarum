# Hello there! Kumusta?

My name is Paula and I am an academic researcher from Baguio City, Philippines. I have worked at the [Cordillera Studies Center](https://csc3.upb.edu.ph/) of the [University of the Philippines Baguio](https://www.upb.edu.ph/) since 2012, and my area of specialization is in academic publishing. I like to dabble in a variety of things, but it feels like my gravitational center always lies in editing and publications.

I engage regularly with the production of [The Cordillera Review](https://thecordillerareview.upb.edu.ph/), UP Baguio's academic journal, as well as our full [book projects](https://shopee.ph/cordillera_studies_center). I enjoy learning about research methodologies, developments in knowledge management, and new things in general.

My research interests include cultural studies, postcolonial discourses of childrearing, critical heritage studies, studies of childhood and empire.
