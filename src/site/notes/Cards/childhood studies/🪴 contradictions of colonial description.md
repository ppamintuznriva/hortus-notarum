@janmohamedEconomyManicheanAllegory1995 gives an example through Joyce Cary's *Aissa Saved* where African children are described as having 'gravity and decorum' (Cary 1949, 33) while Christianized adult Africans are 'naughty, irresponsible children' (JanMohamed 1995, 21).

This is because children pose no threat to colonialism, and [[Cards/childhood studies/ðŸŒ± focus on children enabled postponement of independence to the next generation(s)\|ðŸŒ± focus on children enabled postponement of independence to the next generation(s)]] instead of the present one (cf. @mcelhinnyKissingBabyNot2005).
