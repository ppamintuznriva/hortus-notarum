For Zotero's own support guide on creating colored tags (as well as an overview on Collections), go [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags). I initially learned about creating a colored tag system via [Brian Jenks](https://notes.bryanjenks.dev/Z/Tag+Taxonomy).

As of this writing, I have 800+ sources in my Zotero Library/Antilibrary. While my workflow typically involves keeping my most recently modified files always on top of the list, it can still be overwhelming to keep track of where I am with multiple resources. Enter: Emoji Zotero tags. They're basically colored tags but instead of colorful squares, we assign emojis.

Here's the Tag Taxonomy that I currently use.
