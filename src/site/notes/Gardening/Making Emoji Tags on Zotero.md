For Zotero's own support guide on creating colored tags (as well as an overview on Collections), go [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags). I initially learned about creating a colored tag system via [Brian Jenks](https://notes.bryanjenks.dev/Z/Tag+Taxonomy).

As of this writing, I have 800+ sources in my Zotero Library/Antilibrary. While my workflow typically involves keeping my most recently modified files always on top of the list, it can still be overwhelming to keep track of where I am with multiple resources. Enter: Emoji Zotero tags. They're basically colored tags but instead of colorful squares, we assign emojis.

Here's a quick and dirty guide on how to make and use them:
1. Scroll down the metadata window of your selected resource and look for the section for tags. Click on the plus sign and assign an emoji of your choice (my own Tag Taxonomy is at the bottom).![Screenshot 2025-02-10 at 1.55.20 PM.png](/img/user/Extras/Screenshot%202025-02-10%20at%201.55.20%20PM.png)
2. You should see the tag you made in the Tag Selector pane on the lower left of Zotero. BUT you will not see it beside your resource title yet. You have to right click it and assign it a color for it to show. You can assign colors to up to nine tags.

3. After assigning your tag a color, you should be able to see it beside your resource title (as above).

Here's the Tag Taxonomy that I currently use.
