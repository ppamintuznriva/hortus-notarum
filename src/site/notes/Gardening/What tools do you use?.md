### Note-taking, Note-making, and Writing

I follow [[Sources/000 Reading Notes/ðŸ“– SÃ¶nke Ahrens 2017\|ðŸ“– SÃ¶nke Ahrens 2017]] [[ðŸª¨ Tool Box\|ðŸª¨ Tool Box]] for keeping a Zettelkasten, where you basically need only four tools and that "More is unnecessary, less is impossible" (loc. 564).

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)- for (mostly) everything. I've used a lot of note-taking and writing software, but Obsidian has been the best for me in terms of customizability (can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be) and linked, visual thinking. 

[Kindle Scribe](https://shopee.ph/Amazon-Kindle-Scribe-(10.2%E2%80%9D-Screen-300-ppi)-Paperwhite-display-i.71919147.22811207184) - simple enough, and I carry it everywhere. Notebooks and annotations are easily exported. I got mine from a Hong Kong store on Shopee.

regular- and passport-sized Travel Notebooks (TNs) - I usually only carry the passport-sized TN in my small EDC (everyday carry)

> [!quote] Tool #2
> A reference management system (the best programs are free)

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) - completely free (unless you manage, like me, to go over the free storage allotment. It's a fair deal, though, and I like being able to access all my PDFs from anywhere and any device). I could rave about Zotero ALL DAY and if you give me a chance, I will.

> The slip-box (the best program is free)

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) again - Great for making bi-directional links, and easy enough to learn (I have close to zero computer science background and I learned it fine. Like most things, patience and enthusiasm will get you through). The community is filled with wonderful, clever, and generous folks who build plugins, answer questions, make tutorials, etc. 

> [!quote] Tool #4
> An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free)


[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) AGAIN - but with the help of plugins like [Pandoc](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-pandoc) and Enhancing [Export](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-enhancing-export). I like using Google Docs sometimes, too, which can be integrated with Zotero as well.

### How I get my digital garden online

This digital garden is published from my Obsidian vault (my greenhouse) using the [Digital Garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) by Oleeskild, via [Github.com](https://github.com/)and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Oleeskild has a pretty good step-by-step tutorial on their page but I also found this [tutorial](https://dudethatserin.com/obsidian-digital-garden-series/) from Dude, That's Erin! really helpful.

The theme I'm using now is Minimal (Things Flavor).
