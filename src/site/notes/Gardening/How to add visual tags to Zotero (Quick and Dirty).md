You can tell I'm a millennial by the extent of my emoji use.

It's an efficient way for me to keep tabs (or tags??) on what I am currently reading,  what I have finished, and everything that's in between. Here's how to do it:

1. Select the paper on Zotero and click on the tag icon at the bottom row.

2. Click on the (+) sign and add your preferred emoji/symbol. For Mac, you can press Command + Control + Spacebar. I think it's Â Windows logo key + . (period) on Windows.

3. Once your emoji tag appears on the tag list on the left side, right click it and assign it a color.

4. The tags should appear beside the title, allowing for quick reference.
