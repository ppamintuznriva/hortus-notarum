## As you explore this digital garden, remember:
1. *Embrace the unrefined*: Some/most ideas here are works in progress. I could be wrong and/or I could be right, and that's ok!
2. *Feel free to wander*: These thoughts are not strictly organized, feel free to jump between links and see where they take you. (You'll notice that some links are still beiged [?] out, that's because I haven't finished deploying everything from my greenhouse as I am actually currently busy writing)
3. *Check timestamps*: Note when a piece was last tended to.
4. *Engage thoughtfully*: Comments and discussions are welcome, you can find me on X/Twitter at [@mapalupari](https://x.com/mapalupari). The anonymous [[Got Feedback?\|Got Feedback?]] is up now!
5. *Be a responsible visitor:* Not sure where you stand in the digital garden? Check the [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) by Shawn Wang.
