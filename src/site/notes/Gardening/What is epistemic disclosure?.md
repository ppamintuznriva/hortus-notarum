Basically, a declaration of how I know what I know, the level of confidence/belief I have that what I know is true, and how much effort I've put into knowing what I know.

Right now, I have disclosures on [[Gardening/epistemic status\|epistemic status]] and [[Gardening/epistemic effort\|epistemic effort]], but I want to [[Gardening/Digital Garden To Do List#Housekeeping\|fix how the callouts look]] a little bit .

Right now, looks like this

>[!info] [[Gardening/epistemic status\|epistemic status]]:
>semi-believed. i think this is right, but this needs more engagement to understand and utilize

What if:

<font size=3> [ **epistemic status**: *semi-believed. i think this is right, but this needs more engagement to understand and utilize* ]</font>


Right now I'm trying custom callouts using the [Callout Manager Plugin](https://github.com/eth-p/obsidian-callout-manager):

> [!epistemic-status] 

> [!epistemic-effort]

Somehow these are not showing up on my digital garden the way that I want it to. ðŸ˜© I think the brackets would look better and less obtrusive. I wish I could make it look like how it looks for me.
