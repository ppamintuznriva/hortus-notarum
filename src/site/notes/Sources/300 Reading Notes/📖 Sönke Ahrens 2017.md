## Highlights
Everybody writes. Especially in academia — location: [85]()
{ #ref-63323}


---
writing doesn’t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. — location: [86]()
{ #ref-15897}


---
Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note. — location: [90]()
{ #ref-32878}


---
What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. — location: [98]()
{ #ref-59400}


---
Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. — location: [106]()
{ #ref-34188}


---
There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. — location: [111]()
{ #ref-46218}


---
If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. — location: [115]()
{ #ref-9530}


---
What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily? — location: [121]()
{ #ref-53330}


---
They struggle because they believe, as they are made to believe, that writing starts with a blank page. — location: [125]()
{ #ref-14996}


---
Just having it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is the hard bit. That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. — location: [126]()
{ #ref-56020}


---
The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. — location: [129]()
{ #ref-7008}


---
the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work. — location: [133]()
{ #ref-58350}


---
What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand — location: [137]()
{ #ref-64918}


---
Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. — location: [142]()
{ #ref-20312}


---
We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. — location: [147]()
{ #ref-29509}


---
Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. — location: [149]()
{ #ref-29530}


---
“I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” — location: [158]()
{ #ref-57854}


---
A good structure is something you can trust. — location: [160]()
{ #ref-18068}


---
If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. — location: [161]()
{ #ref-63238}


---
By breaking down the amorphous task of “writing a paper” into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one — location: [163]()

The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. — location: [176]()
{ #ref-6739}


---
it is usually the best students who struggle the most. Good students wrestle with their sentences because they care about finding the right expression. — location: [185]()
{ #ref-23044}


---
Having read more does not automatically mean having more ideas. Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them. — location: [188]()
{ #ref-62966}


---
a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent — location: [192]()
{ #ref-21240}


---
poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. — location: [196]()
{ #ref-46926}


---
those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. — location: [199]()
{ #ref-15423}


---
This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are — location: [203]()
{ #ref-33777}


---
writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing. — location: [206]()
{ #ref-25177}


---
it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas. — location: [213]()
{ #ref-53796}


---
The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible — location: [218]()
{ #ref-47139}


---
It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. — location: [223]()
{ #ref-59307}


---
There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway. — location: [224]()
{ #ref-5229}


---
Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly — location: [234]()
{ #ref-34874}


---
Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place — location: [235]()
{ #ref-27271}


---
“Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001). — location: [239]()
{ #ref-24363}


---
The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. — location: [240]()
{ #ref-12025}


---
a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. — location: [244]()
{ #ref-33544}


---
the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. — location: [260]()
{ #ref-34999}


---
Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. — location: [261]()
{ #ref-32266}


---
Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together. — location: [262]()
{ #ref-62162}


---
Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. — location: [266]()
{ #ref-41895}


---
“I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” — location: [326]()
{ #ref-7088}


---
The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. — location: [334]()
{ #ref-38595}


---
it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. — location: [335]()
{ #ref-50860}


---
Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned – which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work. — location: [337]()
{ #ref-6155}


---
success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place — location: [342]()
{ #ref-46386}


---
This is not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right workflow. — location: [344]()
{ #ref-28139}


---
Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ. — location: [349]()
{ #ref-44028}


---
The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. — location: [392]()
{ #ref-55774}


---
We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. — location: [413]()
{ #ref-21707}


---
Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach. — location: [423]()
{ #ref-48500}


---
Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. — location: [445]()
{ #ref-26341}


---
Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. — location: [448]()
{ #ref-16331}


---
Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway. — location: [449]()
{ #ref-36849}


---
as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” — location: [454]()
{ #ref-30022}


---
If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. — location: [457]()
{ #ref-60555}


---
1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. — location: [463]()
{ #ref-34543}


---
2. Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. — location: [469]()
{ #ref-46295}


---
Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes – don’t copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean. — location: [470]()
{ #ref-21758}


---
3. Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. — location: [473]()
{ #ref-24041}


---
Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. — location: [477]()
{ #ref-21307}


---
Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box — location: [481]()
{ #ref-36588}


---
5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. — location: [490]()
{ #ref-16202}


---
Just follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight. Build upon what you have. — location: [493]()
{ #ref-17493}


---
Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. — location: [495]()
{ #ref-45730}


---
Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. — location: [496]()
{ #ref-54247}


---
The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. — location: [497]()
{ #ref-46751}


---
After a while, you will have developed ideas far enough to decide on a topic to write about. — location: [500]()
{ #ref-59172}


---
Look for what is missing and what is redundant. Don’t wait until you have everything together. — location: [504]()
{ #ref-49319}


---
Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don’t simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time. — location: [506]()
{ #ref-37746}


---
Edit and proofread your manuscript. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder and turn to the next manuscript. — location: [509]()
{ #ref-43461}


---
Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator. — location: [521]()
{ #ref-434}


---
Academic writing in itself is not a complicated process that requires a variety of complicated tools, but is in constant danger of being clogged with unnecessary distractions. — location: [543]()
{ #ref-54418}


---
Few of these techniques are particularly complicated in themselves, but they are usually used without any regard to the actual workflow, which then quickly becomes a mess. — location: [551]()
{ #ref-56833}


---
the slip-box is not introduced as another technique, but as a crucial element in an overarching workflow that is stripped of everything that could distract from what is important. — location: [558]()
{ #ref-11476}


---
To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter. — location: [562]()
{ #ref-17255}


---
 [[Efforts/PKM + Hobbies/04 Support Notes/🪨 Tool Box\|🪨 Tool Box]] 
 We need four tools: ·       Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do) ·       A reference management system (the best programs are free) ·       The slip-box (the best program is free) ·       An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free) More is unnecessary, less is impossible. — location: [564]()
{ #ref-6150}


---
we sometimes forget that the handling is as important as the possibilities of the tool itself. — location: [617]()
{ #ref-59938}


---
Writing is what follows: In the beginning stands the question to be answered, followed by an overview of the literature, the discussion of it and the conclusion. This, according to this thinking, prepares you for doing independent research. — location: [644]()
{ #ref-23025}


---
Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. — location: [647]()
{ #ref-34415}


---
There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. — location: [650]()
{ #ref-33142}


---
Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. — location: [651]()
{ #ref-10312}


---
the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. — location: [655]()
{ #ref-63955}


---
Everything within the university aims at some kind of publication. — location: [656]()
{ #ref-42538}


---
It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. — location: [659]()
{ #ref-55809}


---
This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin — location: [663]()
{ #ref-54901}


---
Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. — location: [671]()
{ #ref-50733}


---
Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus. — location: [673]()
{ #ref-39883}


---
you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it. — location: [679]()
{ #ref-37248}


---
And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. — location: [680]()
{ #ref-56009}


---
single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing. — location: [682]()
{ #ref-26768}


---
the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? — location: [729]()
{ #ref-46096}


---
Can’t find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store. — location: [731]()
{ #ref-38105}


---
The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. — location: [738]()
{ #ref-34137}


---
To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic. — location: [854]()
{ #ref-2979}


---
By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force. — location: [867]()
{ #ref-34605}


---
As writing has not accompanied their previous work, they have to either start with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their ideas (which is boring). — location: [875]()
{ #ref-8490}


---
The advice to think about what to write about before you write comes both too early and too late. Too late, as you already have passed up the chance to build up written resources when you face the white sheet of paper or the blank screen, but also too early, if you try to postpone every serious content-related work until you have made a decision on the topic. — location: [882]()
{ #ref-64233}


---
writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. — location: [888]()
{ #ref-35389}


---
How can you not feel threatened by an empty page if you have literally nothing at hand to fill it with? — location: [894]()
{ #ref-64628}


---
Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us. This is the kind of dynamic we are looking for. — location: [920]()
{ #ref-53468}


---
Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward — location: [928]()
{ #ref-61623}


---
Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. — location: [938]()
{ #ref-44356}


---
Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. — location: [939]()
{ #ref-54789}


---
Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. — location: [944]()
{ #ref-50697}

[[Efforts/PKM + Hobbies/04 Support Notes/Gifted Child Syndrome\|Gifted Child Syndrome]]

they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. — location: [946]()
{ #ref-14863}

[[Efforts/PKM + Hobbies/04 Support Notes/Gifted Child Syndrome\|Gifted Child Syndrome]]

Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). — location: [947]()
{ #ref-27286}

[[Efforts/PKM + Hobbies/04 Support Notes/Gifted Child Syndrome\|Gifted Child Syndrome]]

---
To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy. — location: [949]()
{ #ref-41176}


---
Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important — location: [951]()
{ #ref-58196}


---
The linear model of academic writing comes with very few feedback opportunities, and even those are usually spread out over time — location: [954]()
{ #ref-26842}


---
It is not just about increasing the number of opportunities to learn, but also to be able to correct the mistakes we inevitably make. — location: [958]()
{ #ref-12562}


---
Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. — location: [961]()
{ #ref-5645}


---
We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. — location: [962]()
{ #ref-19782}


---
The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle. — location: [977]()
{ #ref-655}


---
the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information. — location: [984]()

Multitasking is not what we think it is. It is not focusing attention on more than one thing at a time. Nobody can do that. When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. — location: [1026]()

The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing.

as we can’t take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost. — location: [1217]()

The smartest way to deal with this kind of limitation is to cheat. Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. — location: [1258]()

The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument. — location: [1422]()

Patterns that help us navigate texts and discourses are not only theories, concepts or the respective terminology, but also typical mistakes we automatically scan an argument for, general categories we apply, writing styles that indicate a certain school of thought or mental models we learn or develop from different insights and can collect like a great and ever-increasing set of thinking tools. Without these tools and reference points, no professional reading or understanding would be possible. — location: [1432]()

There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on what they are best at. — location: [1561]()
