## Abstract

## Related Work

## My Summary

Cultural studies provides latitude for a variety of methodologies in the interest of understanding people's lived experiences, power relations, and how language shapes these elements of human life. However, this does not mean that methodologies do not exist or completely done away with in cultural studies, but that not much has been written about it.

## Highlights

> [!question] 
> Is culture the most important topic to investigate in the face of gruelling global economic inequality and exploitation? (12)

## My Notes

- [[methods vs methodologies\|methods vs methodologies]] 

>[!quote]
> many method books (but certainly not all of them) view methods in positivist terms as 'magnifying glasses' that are inserted between the scholar and the 'reality' being studied. It is understood that if these methods, or lenses, are used correctly, or according to instructions, they will help the scholar to get closer to an 'accurate' or objective and unbiased view of reality. (9)

> [!quote] BUT
> One of the basic aims of this book is, however, to explore how the reality changes when we change the research approach or lens, through which we look at it. (9)

> [!important]
> we need to be more reflexive about the way in which our research always opens up a partial and political perspective on reality (9)

> [!quote] resistance and cultural studies
> ...resistance, as a concept, provided early cultural studies with a way to argue that people have some creative and critical abilities to 'resist' domination (39)

Three analytically different approaches to resistance
1. 'critical contextualist' approach
		- how does resistance affect 'real' structures of dominance? i.e., patriarchy, class 
		- tends to be pessimistic about the possibility of actually enacting change
2. 'optimistic textualist' approach
		- focuses on symbolic resistance
		- tends to be optimistic about the ability to enact change


> [!quote] similarity shared by critical contextualist and optimistic textualist approaches
> This similarity is their tendency to analyze resistance in terms of its alleged effects on a 'system', such as 'patriarchy' (40)

3. 'contingent' approach
	- "what types of power [does] this activity resist and what type of power [does] it buttresses"?

ðŸŽ¯ **The 'Critical Contextualist' approach**
- resistance has both creative and futile aspects
- note the focus on *context*, which naturally involves viewing resistance against its effects on reality

> [!NOTE] [[The Lived Experienceâ€“Hegemony Cycle?\|The Lived Experienceâ€“Hegemony Cycle?]]
Lived Experience -> people's capacity to resist -> acting on that capacity -> obfuscation by ideology/hegemony that legitimizes social order -> mediation between people and the world/reality

> [!Quote] Page 55
> the problem with this approach to resistance is that it presumes thescholar to be able to know what â€˜realâ€™ structures people are resisting [(p. 55)](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BYDG93K2?page=55&annotation=FK2P5XWF)
^^ To be able to pass a value judgment on a people's resistance, the researcher assumes full knowledge of a people's reality. At the same time, there is a perception of hierarchy in this knowledge (i.e., that the people doing the resisting are not aware of their resistance, as if under the 'spell' of hegemony that the researcher must break)

- #insight The researcher is not an objective observer to phenomenon and brings to the table their own set of of frameworks and biases

ðŸŽ¯ **The 'Optimistic Textualist' approach**
- Saukko mentions John Fiske as a representative thinker following this approach, where symbolic resistance is viewed as 'as real as' forms of resistance which lead to systemic change in society (e.g., young women identifying/idolizing with Madonna's overt sexuality in response to the patriarchy they experience, Korean and Japanese youth identifying with Black culture in response to their conservative and militaristic culture)
- This approach may be/has been viewed as too watered down and prone to over-interpretation by the researcher
- Oddly enough, like the previous approach, this one also has a tendency for 'ventriloquism' (Morris 1990) where although more obvious, the researcher still uses their respondents and their lived experiences as a front for their own ideology

ðŸŽ¯ **The 'Contingent' approach**
- Saukko posits that both 'critical contextualist' and 'optimistic textual' approaches operate within 'an imaginary where resistance is claimed to affect, or not to affect, the 'system'' (50).
- Both previous approaches 'obey the logic of a vertical notion of power' where those at the bottom have less power than those at the top. On the other hand, she proposes 'a shift towards a more contingent or lateral notion of power and resistance'
- Thus, instead of focusing on whether an act/local resistance is able to affect the system in general, she poses to consider the act's specific effects and how it relates to other issues (i.e., what does the act specifically do/try to do?)
