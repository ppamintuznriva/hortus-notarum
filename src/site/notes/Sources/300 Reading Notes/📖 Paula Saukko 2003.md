## Abstract

## Related Work

## My Summary

Cultural studies provides latitude for a variety of methodologies in the interest of understanding people's lived experiences, power relations, and how language shapes these elements of human life. However, this does not mean that methodologies do not exist or completely done away with in cultural studies, but that not much has been written about it.

## Highlights

> [!question] 
> Is culture the most important topic to investigate in the face of gruelling global economic inequality and exploitation? (12)

## My Notes

- [[methods vs methodologies\|methods vs methodologies]] 

>[!quote]
> many method books (but certainly not all of them) view methods in positivist terms as 'magnifying glasses' that are inserted between the scholar and the 'reality' being studied. It is understood that if these methods, or lenses, are used correctly, or according to instructions, they will help the scholar to get closer to an 'accurate' or objective and unbiased view of reality. (9)

> [!quote] BUT
> One of the basic aims of this book is, however, to explore how the reality changes when we change the research approach or lens, through which we look at it. (9)

> [!important]
> we need to be more reflexive about the way in which our research always opens up a partial and political perspective on reality (9)

### Part II Studying Lived Experience

> [!quote] resistance and cultural studies
> ...resistance, as a concept, provided early cultural studies with a way to argue that people have some creative and critical abilities to 'resist' domination (39)

- Three analytically different approaches to resistance
	- 'critical contextualist' approach
		- how does resistance affect 'real' structures of dominance? i.e., patriarchy, class 
		- tends to be pessimistic about the possibility of actually enacting change
	- 'optimistic textualist'
		- focuses on symbolic resistance
		- tends to be optimistic about the ability to enact change


> [!quote] similarity shared by critical contextualist and optimistic textualist approaches
> This similarity is their tendency to analyze resistance in terms of its alleged effects on a 'system', such as 'patriarchy' (40)

- 'contingent' approach
	- "what types of power [does] this activity resist and what type of power [does] it buttresses"?1
