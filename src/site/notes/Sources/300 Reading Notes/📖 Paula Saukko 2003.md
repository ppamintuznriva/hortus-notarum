## Abstract

## My Summary

Cultural studies provides latitude for a variety of methodologies in the interest of understanding people's lived experiences, power relations, and how language shapes these elements of human life. However, this does not mean that methodologies do not exist or completely done away with in cultural studies, but that not much has been written about it.

## Highlights

> [!question] Is culture the most important topic to investigate in the face of gruelling global economic inequality and exploitation? (12)

## My Notes

- [[methods vs methodologies\|methods vs methodologies]] 

>[!quote]
> many method books (but certainly not all of them) view methods in positivist terms as 'magnifying glasses' that are inserted between the scholar and the 'reality' being studied. It is understood that if these methods, or lenses, are used correctly, or according to instructions, they will help the scholar to get closer to an 'accurate' or objective and unbiased view of reality. (9)

> [!quote] BUT
> One of the basic aims of this book is, however, to explore how the reality changes when we change the research approach or lens, through which we look at it. (9)

> [!important]
> we need to be more reflexive about the way in which our research always opens up a partial and political perspective on reality (9)

- tension: [[what authority do we have, as researchers, to 'understand' other people's lives?\|what authority do we have, as researchers, to 'understand' other people's lives?]] -> brought about by the posts (postmodernity, postcolonialism, etc.)

>[!quote] the positivist notion of science
>...the positivist notion of science, which understands the purpose of research to be the creation of true and objective knowledge of reality, following a scientific method. (17-18)

>[!quote] Dialogism does not view research in terms of describing other worlds from the outside, but in terms of an encounter or interaction between different worlds. (20)

>[!quote] on the advantages of thinking in terms of multiple validities
>instead of considering this an outrage, scholarship suggesting multiple validities ask us to be more critically aware of what drives our research (18)

>[!quote] on the advantages of multiple validities
>to come up with more multidimensional, nuanced, and tentative way of understanding one's object of study (18)

> [!question] What would be the purpose of social inquiry without a social agenda?
