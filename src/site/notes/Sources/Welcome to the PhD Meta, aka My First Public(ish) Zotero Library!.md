In preparing to do a PhD in Oceania, I realize that I've gathered a fair number of resources on doing PhDs. Since someone from the PhD in Australia Facebook group asked, I made this public (-ish because you still need a Zotero account to join) [Group Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/6062747/phd_meta). If you need these resources, feel free to sign up and I will approve as soon as I can!
